This is the final project for CS 5630/6630. This project is authored by: Jordan Pyper; u0363195; u0363195@utah.edu, Hunter Finney; u1319765; u1319765@utah.edu, and Jackson Leach; u1110821; jackson.leach@utah.edu. All of this code was done without the use of any prebuilt libraries other than what was provided and taught in class. Below are links to external websites that host our project.

Instructions to use our visualization:
This website is optimized for 1080p monitors at full screen resolution. While the visualization would still work, there may be overlapping views or unreasonable layouts in differing formats.

To dismiss the opening debriefing click anywhere on the screen.

The map view can be found in the upper left-hand side of the screen. To interact with this element, click on any colored country to see a detailed view of that country. Click the “X” to dismiss the detailed view. A drop-down menu is located in the far top left corner of the screen. This will allow you to change which personality trait is being portrayed in the map view. 

The table view to the upper right is linked with the map view. This table will update based on the drop-down menu selected in the map view. Here you can sort ascending and descending by clicking the headers above the data. 

The parallel coordinates view is located in the bottom left. This view can be brushed over by clicking and dragging an area over a particular axis. This will highlight countries brushed over and add them to the table immediately to the right. Once a brush is made you can drag the area up and down that particular axis. To clear all selection just click anywhere on the parallel coordinates view.
